# dlfm_makam_recognition_experiments
This package contains the complete experimental data explained in:

    Karakurt, A., Şentürk S., & Serra X. (2016).  MORTY: A Toolbox for Mode Recognition and Tonic Identification. 3rd International Digital Libraries for Musicology Workshop. 

The zip file includes the folds, features, training and testing data, results and evaluation file. It is part of the [experiments hosted in github](https://github.com/sertansenturk/makam_recognition_experiments/tree/dlfm2016) in the  folder call "./data". We host the experiment data in [Zenodo](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.57999) separately due to the file size limitations in github.

For a thorough explanation please refer to the [companion page](http://compmusic.upf.edu/node/319) in the CompMusic website and the paper itself. For additional information please contact the authors.
